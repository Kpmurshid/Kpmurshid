## Hi there üëã

# Hi, I'm Muhammed Murshid KP

**Bioinformatician | ML Enthusiast | MD Simulations | NGS | Drug Discovery**

I'm a bioinformatics researcher with strong expertise in computational biology, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning, NGS data analysis, and antibiotic resistance research. I have hands-on experience building ML models to analyze protein conformational dynamics, pharmacophore modeling, and large-scale sequencing workflows.

Currently, I'm a Research Assistant at Telscie Genetics, working on targeted antibiotic technologies and their molecular impact. I also served as a research scholar at CCS HAU, where I explored protein folding complexity using MD simulations and machine learning.

### üî¨ Research Focus
- Protein-ligand interactions & mutation analysis  
- Pharmacophore modeling of resistant pathogens  
- High-throughput sequencing & NGS data pipelines  
- AI/ML-driven analysis of biological systems  

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Python, SQL, Bash, GROMACS, PyMOL, ChimeraX, AutoDock Vina, PyFoldX, DSSP, AlphaFold, SwissModel, Nextflow, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, BioPython, DBMS, Linux

### üìÇ Notable Projects
- **Antibiotic Resistance Mutation DB**  
  A custom-curated repository of mutated proteins involved in antibiotic resistance with ligand binding analysis.

- **Œ≤-hairpin Folding Analysis (GB1)**  
  Identified optimal collective variables using machine learning on MD simulation data.

- **NGS Workflow Automation**  
  Built scalable and reproducible NGS pipelines for high-throughput sequencing data analysis using Nextflow and Python.

### üß† Certifications
- Python for Genomic Data Science (Coursera)  
- Data Visualization with Python (Coursera, upGrad)  
- SQL for Data Science (Coursera)
